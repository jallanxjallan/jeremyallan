description: Bali Blues looks at the aftermath of the Bali Bomb in 2002.

On 12 October 2002, a suicide bomb attack devastated the heart of the beach resort of Kuta,
Bali, claiming 202 victims and injuring hundreds of more. Though the
attack was over in seconds, the effects reverberated for months as the
local economy collapsed, and the Balinese struggled to understand why
such an appalling tragedy had befallen their peaceful island.

Bali Blues chronicles the heart-rending, harrowing, and
ultimately inspiring events that occurred during the year following the
Bali Bomb. Jeremy tells these stories through the eyes those most affected by
the crime: the people of Kuta. A Balinese hotel manager 
attempts to balance the demands of his community obligations with his
professional responsibilities to his Jakarta-based superior. This brings
him into conflict with a neighborhood leader who strives to prevent his
community\'s character and traditions from being overwhelmed by the
onslaught of economic migrants, which in turn contributes to the
discrimination a bar girl faces as she struggles to support her
impoverished family in rural Java. These stories, and others, provide an
intriguing glimpse into an Indonesian community that, in a generation,
has grown from an impoverished seaside village into a cosmopolitan
tourist resort.

Bali Blues also examines the background of the attack itself, the growth
of a fanatical form of Islam that gave birth to the terrorists, and the
open, tolerant Balinese society that allowed the perpetrators to operate
undetected in their midst: culminating in a riveting, minute-by-minute
reconstruction of the planning, execution, and aftermath of the Bali
Bomb.
