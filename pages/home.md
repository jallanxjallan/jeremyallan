Four decades of living in and writing about Indonesia has given Canadian author Jeremy Allan a rare perspective on his adoptive homeland. Through producing written content for books, magazine articles, videos, and promotional literature, Jeremy has sought to portray Indonesia in a fair and positive manner and to promote the interests of Indonesian businesses, cultural and social organizations, and the nation itself.

In the 2001 book  [Jakarta Jive ](link://slug/jakarta_jive) Jeremy depicted the tumultuous events surrounding the end of President Soeharto's three-decade authoritarian rule  through the eyes of the people who were affected most: the residents of Jakarta. Three years later,  [Bali Blues](link://slug/bali_blues) chronicled the heart-rending, harrowing, and
ultimately inspiring events that occurred during the year following the 2002 terrorist bombing in the tourist resort of Kuta, Bali.
